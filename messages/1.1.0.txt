Neon Color Scheme v1.1.1
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a significant update from 1.0.1. I've recently started using Sass/SCSS
as I work on the upcoming Neon Color Scheme website, and installed the Syntax
Highlighting for Sass package (among others) for ST2. While the CSS scopes in
Neon are fairly complete, I was missing some Sass ones, so those have now been
added. Internally, I did a major reorganization, so related items like `keyword`
and `keyword.other` are now grouped together. I also tweaked some (but not too
many) of the colors - `Class` is brighter, with no background, and HTML overall
looks better, I think.

I try to make as many languages as possible look as good and balanced as
possible, so if you want me to pay extra attention to your favorite language, or
if you have any suggestions, questions, concerns, bugs, unexpected behavior, or
just want to say thanks, please open an issue or a pull request on Github, or
send me a tweet. If you like what you see, please consider supporting my work
with a gittip or Paypal donation - see the README for details.

   Thanks,
   @MattDMo
